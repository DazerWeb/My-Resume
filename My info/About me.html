<p>I just recently started learning how to program websites, and this website is actually one of the projects I workedon during my training course. Programming hasn't been easy for me but I've been determined to  work no matter the circumstance. It has been a battle because I've been tempteed so many times to play games but I just always try to be focused. I started learning when one of my family friend called and introduced me to Web Development and bought me a course by Angela Yu.I love her course, because she explains it to me well, though it is online, it still explains it in details.
